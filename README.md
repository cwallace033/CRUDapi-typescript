# Overview

I created this program in order to better understand how typescript worked. It is a basic CRUD api that connects to a database in MongoDb. It allows the creation and storage of contacts.
It also allows you to update, view and delete those contacts.

# Development Environment

To create this program I used VS Code. I used mongoose to help me connect to MongoDb. 

The program was created using Node.js, Express, and typescript.

# Future Work

- I would like to add swagger to this program. I think it is better for testing than just using .rest
- There is more validation that I would like to add such as length requirements
